## Narrative Intelligence and Impact Signatures of Flash Flood Events in DC, Maryland, and Virginia

### Project Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to develop a data-driven framework for understanding and quantifying the impacts of the flash floods in Washington, D.C., and its neighboring counties in Maryland and Virginia. We focus on event from 1996 to the present that include narrative description, extracting structured impact information, computing a Flood Impact Score (FIS) for each event, and analyzing patterns in severity and typology. Ultimately, we intend to obtain findings which can be used to inform resilience strategies and emergency planning by identifying high-impact flood scenarios.
