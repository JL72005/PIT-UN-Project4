# Narrative Intelligence and Impact Signatures of Flash Flood Events in DC, Maryland, and Virginia

## Project Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to improve understanding of the impacts of the flash floods in Washington, D.C., and its neighboring counties in Maryland and Virginia by utilizing data science techniques. We focus on events from 1996 to the present that include narrative description, with the primary objectives to extract structured impact information from unstructured event narratives using large language models (LLMs), compute a Flood Impact Score (FIS) for each event, and analyzing contextual patterns such as co-occurence of impact types, spatial clustering, and temporal trends. Ultimately, we intend to obtain findings which can be used to inform resilience strategies and emergency planning by identifying high-impact flood scenarios. 

## Data Sources
Data used in this project is sourced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Storm Events Data base. This dataset provides information about flash floods in the D.C., Maryland, and Virginia area from 1996 to the present. A key feature of this dataset is its inclusion of “narratives”: qualitative descriptions of each flood event.

## How to Run Code
To run the code, users should open the taggingV1.ipynb file and execute each cell sequentially. The workflow is chronological: it begins with downloading and filtering the raw NOAA data, then applies LLMs to extract structured impact tags from the narrative text. Then, we compute the Flood Impact Score (FIS) for each event and generate visual analytics.
